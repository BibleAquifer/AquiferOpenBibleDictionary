## Yoke (id: 9106)

YOKE
====

The wooden bar that linked two (or more) draft animals so they could work together ([Numbers 19:2](https://ref.ly/Num19:2); [1 Kings 19:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19); [Job 1:3](https://ref.ly/Job1:3)). Besides its literal use, the Bible often uses the term metaphorically. It refers to work or bondage ([Leviticus 26:13](https://ref.ly/Lev26:13)). Israel's own kings, not just foreign oppressors, applied the yoke of bondage ([1 Kings 12:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4-1Kgs12:14)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4-1Kgs12:14)[14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4-1Kgs12:14); [2 Chronicles 10:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:4-2Chr10:14)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:4-2Chr10:14)[14](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:4-2Chr10:14)). In prophetic writings, the yoke of bondage was linked to divine judgment ([Lamentations 1:14](https://ref.ly/Lam1:14)). So, deliverance was seen as God breaking the yoke that had enslaved Israel ([Isaiah 9:4](https://ref.ly/Isa9:4); [10:27](https://ref.ly/Isa10:27); [14:25](https://ref.ly/Isa14:25); [58:6](https://ref.ly/Isa58:6); [Jeremiah 2:20](https://ref.ly/Jer2:20); [5:5](https://ref.ly/Jer5:5)). Jeremiah's dispute with Hananiah's prophecy was about the yoke of bondage. Hananiah claimed that Judah would soon be freed from Babylonian captivity ([Jeremiah 27:8](https://ref.ly/Jer27:8-Jer27:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer27:8-Jer27:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Jer27:8-Jer27:11); [28:1](https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17)[17](https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17)). 

In the New Testament, Jesus makes "yoke" a positive term. He asks people to take up his yoke, which is not burdensome. He will give them rest for their souls ([Matthew 11:29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29-Matt11:30)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29-Matt11:30)[30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29-Matt11:30)).

## Yom Kippur (id: 9107)

YOM KIPPUR
==========

Yom Kippur is the Hebrew name for the Day of Atonement. It was one of the most important holy days in ancient Israel. It was also called the Day of Atonement. On this day, the high priest performed special ceremonies to ask God to forgive the sins of the people. It was a day for the Israelites to stop working, fast, and show sorrow for their sins ([Leviticus 23:26–32](https://ref.ly/Lev23:26-Lev23:32)). 

The name *Yom Kippur* means “Day of Atonement” in Hebrew. It comes from words that mean “day” (*yom*) and “to make atonement” (*kippur*). It was the only day each year when the high priest could enter the most holy place in the tabernacle.

*See* Feasts and Festivals of Israel.
